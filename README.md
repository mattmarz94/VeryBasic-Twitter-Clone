# VeryBasic-Twitter-Clone

This is a very basic twitter clone which i am buiding using what I have learned so far.

Such as the text area input-field. A method used to iterate over my data using forEach, and also practiced bettering my skills with the filter function which helped me filter an array for the results i needed. I've used data attributes to store data inside elements which enabled me to tell which tweet an icon belonged to. Also i conditionally rendered styling into the application which allowed me to add color to an icon when clicked and unclicked. I made use of the ! NOT operator to flip a boolean into it's inverse state. Lastly I used the imported uuid js function to generate uuids to create unqiue ids for each rendered tweet.

I plan on adding more functionality to this application as time goes on and my knowledge explands. :)
